1,2016-09-11,0,0,168,True,Recommended,It's a good game but a bad thing is how glitched the bears are. If you do play you'll understand. But it gets alot more fun if you play with a friend instead of soloing.,Rust
2,2017-09-16,0,0,492,False,Not Recommended,it's fun at the start but servers are made by killers (u or someone that plays as killer will create the lobby and ur ping depends on his network and ur latency to his location) sometimes killers start downloading and so u cant receive data from server and they kill you instantly sometimes killer leaves the lobby and u lose ur offerings as a survivor and much much more bugs and issues that really need to be fixed. still there is no ranking rewards that you will probably say why i should try to be in the better divisions ? a lot of bugs and glitches will happen occasionally that make you feel uncomfortable. fulfilled with sadistic players that enjoy humiliation or annoying other players for both side player and killers i mean not by the game mechanism.let me tell u an example that one time the killer body blocked me in a position of map and stayed for about 10 minutes and locked me there so i couldn't do anything. or one time a killer got me and wanted to kill me he was clicking on killing button rapidly and let me see the cinematic and unclick click unclick click unclick for about 5 minutes i couldn't do anything but watching this sadistic player that is trying to annoy me by watchin his killing cinematics. the reporting system is very low quality. a good example could be that they have no control over games and they can't spectate them! killers can see survivors in the lobby before the game starts and this may cause that they contact with eachother and thats not fair because sometimes they intentionally feed eachother and ruin the whole game.if you think that u can challenge yourself u r making a wrong decision to buy because this game needs a lot of balancing and fixes.,Dead by Daylight
3,2017-02-13,0,0,1340,True,Recommended,When I first started playing Rust I noticed how toxic the community could be but don't let that stop you from giving this game a go.It is a lot of fun and the PvP combat is pretty good.It is lacking any sort of tutorial and just throws you into the world which can be daunting but after a couple of hours of being killed by anyone you see on sight you will pick up the basics and build your first starter.When you come on the next day it will be gone and everything you worked for lost but this is ok after a while you will learn how to gather and build faster and learn from your mistakesoverall it takes a while to get used to but once you get going its a very fun game,Rust
4,2016-10-29,0,0,1,False,Recommended,Product received for free. alright first of all let me say this game is a classic and one many rpg players or gamers in general will never forget me included but does this remaster live up to the hype? yes and noI cant really complain about wasting money because I got it for free alongside the other people with all the DLC i digress what i mean by no is the pc players specifically the modded players. I myself played around 430 hours of always 100+ mods and it was amazing i loved the game skyrim base and with mods the entire experience kicks off but any modded player will tell you skyrim just isnt as good without mods the graphics cant compare some followers e.g. Sofia are far superior and much more. And i completely agree I would never play skyrim vanilla vs skyrim modded if i had the choice. and its just the vanilla vs modded experience is heavily one sided on the mod side so theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods.but what i mean by yes is in about 2 3 months if enbs are supported and the modders of skyrim port their mods into the new game as many are already itll be faaaaaaaaar better because of bethesda fixing some bugs and the new 64bit engine and the scripts (although when it comes out you should 100% swap to skse se because its far far far superior and many mods require it e.g skyui) so when everything gets updated and ported it should be a far superior experience compared to 2011 skyrim.overall i most likely wont be playing the game for a while at least until skse or skyui somehow is supported for the new game. But when those mods are ported and availible for the game? ill be playing like its 2011 again im really excited for the remastered mods but a remaster of the actual game? didnt need it it wouldve been nicer to see a full new fresh remaster of oblivion or morrowind instead. so in conclusion theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods. However if you just want to play the game without mods go ahead and play its just a better skyrim for you but if you want mods youre gonna have to wait until skse se releases but when it does ill be playing it for sure alongside of many other people,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

9,2018-02-15,0,0,845,False,Not Recommended,"Devs you the ""Ban updates"" where you proudly tell us how many people you've just ""banned"" again (pretty much all of them just some cybercafe accounts from china which will just be back in a few days) and the non existent region lock. need the $$$? Or whats the reason for not region locking them wits. Just remove the ing crates then no one has a reason to do this and earn $ other than you. People who might think about buying this game Just don't. You will encounter hackers at least every third game if not more often. Which means that youve played 20 minutes in a game just do die to a wallhack if you didnt die at the beginning to an aimbotter anyway. Feels like im playing a F2P shooter from back in 2005 when developers didnt give a about the hackers in their games cause others spent $$$ on it anyway.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

13,2016-06-25,0,0,141,False,Recommended,I've played this game on and off since it was in beta back in 2016 and it has only gotten better since day 1. I've had a blast playing this both solo and with friends. They keep adding new content that brings a lot of fresh entertainment to the game. Even if you don't have one of the DLCs you still have the chance of playing against the killers or on the maps which is fantastic!! The devs are great to listen to the community and support the game.I can't recommend this game enough if you've been on the fence you shouldn't hesitate to buy it.

Sorry not everyone has the heaps of money to pay all of your microtransactions in online but punishing the singlplayer modding community who is against tampering with the online functions is not the answer.

36,2017-07-25,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Old Skyrim according to steam stats has more users around double last I checked.Bethesada is becoming EA 2.0 Lets make it clear I got this free due to having Skyrim Legendary Edition before this came out and they know odds are most of us would not see a need to buy it as of now I would not recommend spending a dime on it. Nothing it offers is realy worth passing up legendary given your customizing options there. If your system can handle it just imagine how much Better it can handle Skyrim Legendary. Get 60 FPS on SE imagine how much you can handle an ENB set up on your Legendary. I play a modded Fallout 4 and still find myself back in Skyrim old version over this money grab I mean they hid the old version......Wow Bethesda shame on you. Hiding the original? Are you trying that much to become EA? I have spent lots of money through the years on your games and atm I'm thinking I wont be doing so anymore I got this free and see no value in using it over my Original. My guess is this is an attempt at forcing people to use the new paid mods aka the Creation Club. So much for paid mods wont affect anything in a negative way....Odds are they will claim error caused original to be hidden once things get nasty. Original here though at this rate I say hold up on spending money as you are supporting the road to scummy business practice link thanks to other user here http //store.steampowered.com/app/72850/?snr 1_5_9__205,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

40,2017-11-17,0,0,81,True,Recommended,This game is very fun but still requires a decent gaming PC. I don't recommend playing this game with 8gb of RAM or less as it will crash if too much RAM is used up and create virtual RAM causing your pc to become very slow. This is hard and unforgiving especially as you are learning to play the game. However this is very rewarding as well. As you get better you can't stop playing.Hackers are not that rare however.,Rust

55,2015-09-12,0,0,187,False,Not Recommended,I really hate to give this game a bad rep based on something not game related but I feel compelled to warn those thinking of purchasing and losing $60.00. I bought this game after it came out for PC as an upgrade from my PS3 version. Graphics are crisp and beautiful the story is excellent with tons of extras after you finish the main storyline. My problem is with the Rockstar Social Club and their TERRIBLE service. They will not respond to countless emails I have sent to them about how their Social Club launcher will not let me play my game if this was one of the cheaper less new games I probably would not be so passionate about this but for this I feel completely jipped and ripped off. My experience with Rockstar has been one with months of not being able to play the game I spent a lot of money on and after this awful experience I will more than likely be searching for other games to spend my little amount of time one. Social Club is complete garbage and I'm shocked that such a well respected company treats their customers in this manner. Will more than likely not be purchasing another Rockstar product that I cannot even play.,Grand Theft Auto V

I love looting and adding attachments to weapons to create your own style of play. But the play doesn't last long enough. Most plays are spent looting a lot then getting killed from a distant sniper. It's fine when playing Battle Royal as that's what the game is but for the price tag it feels like it's missing something. It's not a juicy ""get your teeth sunk into"" game it's more like a casual game with a heavy price tag.

86,2014-05-11,0,0,233,True,Recommended,Rust...what can i say about a fun enjoyable game like rust.let's see...oh COMPLETLY AWSOMEyou spawn with a rock 2 bandages and a torch your only goal is to survive.i only got the game because my friend said it was fun i realy didnt enjoy but thats because i didnt understand itthis game is so amazing when my friend finaly got on our big trouble was trying to find eachother but we finaly did we did so many amazing things we decided to hide in the mountain's since its more peacefule there untill we could get a gun we noticed that there are these rad zones filled with radiation if your rads go over 500 your dead but the rad areas are full of research kits if you cant craft something you can use these research kits so when you die you can craft it again but me and my friend (jeseipi) decided to wait untill were more radiation resistant come to find out we find this guy's house full of epic loot he had a 9mm pistol along with 9mm ammo i took that when i saw it and found these things called rad pills that take off radiation so after i gathered those i thought we should set camp for the night it began as two little shaks and a campfire outside the a little later after gathering enough materials we had a little tiny fort then we set up this thing called a foundatio wich was wood block used for walls or something so after a little bit more we had this room that noone could raid unless they had c4's (very rare in the game) then i decided to finaly use the rad pill's and go get some epic loot i heard about in the rad zones i brought my gun with me because there are radiated animals and are deadly so after picking off the animals i entered the zone and found lots of things like research kits and rad armor while jeseipi was gathering resources i thought while he gather's resources ill just help us advance in technology and we got to the point where jeseipi had made us this nice sized fort and i had gotten us from 1 pistol to m4's and silencer's so we decided to go to the rad zone together (we had gathered alot more rad pills) and we would work on getting research kits so we can learn how to craft things we dont know how to craft (when you start you can craft the basic stuff under the crafting list you use this research kit to add to the list so you can craft it) and then we had to go for the day so when i got back on i found that a noob had taken his time to break one of my walls and steal all of my things this included m4 two 9mm pistol's and three p250's all my good armor and bunches of important mateial's. so that leaves with me having to recraft everything i did eventualy gt everything (jeseipi was offline and i decided to check on our base while he was away and when you disconnect your character's body will lay there till you log on again leaving you 100% vulnerable unless ur behind a metal door) and the rest of the story will continue tommorow 5/11/2014 at 5 00pm.i highly recommend this game it is extremly fun everyone needs to know this game it is so realistic as well i love the ambience as well there are even Some servers where people have built large villages me and jeseipi went on an empty server so we wouldnt get raided right away.,Rust

169,2017-08-01,0,0,409,True,Not Recommended,I cannot recommend this game for the following reasons Developer's censorship of community Poor quality client/server relationship The client which says it killed first is always right (Due to BlueHole's chosen network format) Developers want to sell a bare bones game that requires you to purchase cosmetics through CS GO lottery system Developers have much needed work for the basic animations and mechanics but they focus on flashy parkour animations? Developers need to fundraise $350k for tournament/charity even though they broke $150 million in sales Developers are keen on making streamers Gods in the community Broken promises Frying Pan (Melee) is capable of deflecting melee/bullets/vehicle collisions when positioned correctly. (Infinite durability) #Broken Lack of proper reason behind loot locations Inconsistent physics for players/vehicles Game's graphics determine whether you see players better or not. Disabling/lowering graphics means an advantage meanwhile beautiful graphics on capable PC's will suffer due to their inability to keep their renderer consistent and clean. This is a major problem in a game where sneaking/hiding is mandatory. The bottom edge of a player darkened while prone. Damage values aren't grounded in logic/physics. Bullets drop while traveling (aside from some...) however decrease in speed or overall penetration doesn't reduce damage received. As a result shotguns headshot at medium to long range dealing 40+ damage per pellet. (100 HP total per player) Weapon diversity lacks good melee options or even a basic military knife Parachute mechanics feel like you're playing Pilot Wings 64...... My bad Pilot Wings 64 had great parachuting mechanics for its time.

198,2018-08-14,0,0,112,False,Recommended,I understand why people don't like this game Requires a good pc to play for only decent visuals you need to have stable internet for multiplayer because there is no reconnect button there are a decent amount of bugs and it's hard to get into if you expected this to be an easy AAA game.But for all those who played early MH games that are used to gameplay &gt visuals and have a stable internet connection this is a must buy. It made everything that was annoying before easier they lowered the grind by a decent amount for the rare stuff and the weapons are really fun to play (especially the ranged ones). The monsters are fun as always.For people who didn't play previous iterations while the barrier of entry definitely lowered it will be still hard to get into. This game mostly focuses on bossfights (which are easier than darksouls in the beginning but get harder than it later) has weapons where you need to watch a youtube video to understand and their tutorial is still weak. A friend who played monster hunter will definitely help. Should you buy it? If you played the previous iterations yes you should. If you have a friend who will help you understand most mechanics yes you should. If you like hard games can accept that you may have to watch youtube videos to fully grasp the game and give this game 10 15 hours before deciding yes you should. If you have an internet connection which disconnects sometimes and want to play multiplayer you shouldn't buy it. If you expect this to be like far cry assaassin's creed you shouldn't buy it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

200,2017-01-03,0,0,203,False,Recommended,After hours upon hours spent on this game I believe I can finally give a clear and honest review of this brilliant game.From a first glance I know the game can look fairly basic and looks like the fun could die out fast but may I reassure you and say that is not the case at all.I owned the game fairly early on in its existance and watching it grow into the game it has become has been amazing. At the start the game came with standard rocket league and a basic version of ranked rocket league along with collectable toppers decals and such.After that DLC's started rolling out every couple of months or so. They were cheap and added new car models and the occasional rocket league pitch. The game continued to progress adding new modes (including one of my personal favourites Hoops). Not only this but the game devlopers imporved the ranked matches massively. They also included crates to get rare car models and other collectables.In conclusion this game is definately one of a kind. Its face paced exciting and while you can have off days your skill definetely improves the longer you play. I am sure I will continue to play this game for many years to come!Overall Game Rating 9/10,Rocket League®

If you dont happen to have a full group of five people then you arn't even able to private q so basically you are unable to play with friends. More over not only can you not play with friends you can't even play with the community. Basically there are no redeeming social aspects to the game and for that I give it a huge thumbs down. I have read that the dev is ""working"" on making group play a real thing but before that they want to make sure people who drop out of games early are punished better. I don't understand why this game even has a ranking system or trys to promote any kind of e sports functions. If it was a lets try to survive a psycho killer with your friends that had all the fun and screams that I enjoyed with a full group of people then it would be a home run. Sadly Starbreeze Studios really dropped the ball on this one. I would check back in on this to see if they fix the social issue because it is super fun just not alone.",Dead by Daylight

217,2016-03-05,0,0,134,True,Recommended,"The Rust that's available to play now on Steam doesn't look remotely like the Rust you might have played last year. Though you can still play that classic version through the game's launcher (under the title Rust Legacy) developer Facepunch has been slowly iterating on a new version of the title for months a build running on a new sleeker engine. However a few features from classic Rust have yet to be implemented in its prettier successor fans of Radtown scavenging for instance are going to be left out in the cold.It really doesn't matter how kind and forgiving a person you may be when you're playing Rust you're playing The Most Dangerous Game.It's a difficult game to describe and not because its core mechanics which blend DayZ's survivalism with Minecraft's resource collection and crafting are especially complicated. It's because no matter how you talk about Rust it never sounds like much fun. ""Oh yeah I collected wood and stones for an hour made a bow killed a deer and then someone shot me with a hunting rifle and I started from scratch.""Yes that sounds terrific. I'll take two.The true joys of Rust are found in its unexpected emergent moments of interaction with its deadly world and deadlier humans. For example this Overview video started off with Justin and I trying to showcase the basics of survival when starting a new life in Rust which was going really well until we stared into the mouth of madness and became the monster we feared so much.",Rust

For Take Two the biggest money maker is the Online portion. By a vast vast amount.And Take Two is so greedy that they pretty much actively sabotage the singleplayer just to get people to play multiplayer and buy their crappy disgustingly overpriced microtransactions. You can't even get the Hydra a fan favourite jet of the series in singleplayer without the use of mods. Which brings me to my next point.Take Two has sent a cease and desist to the developers of the biggest modding tools for GTA IV and GTA V. Basically saying ""Stop doing that or we'll sue."" They just want more people to play multiplayer instead of singleplayer and buy their crappy microtransactions because everything costs to much. Do not buy this game. Do not support this crap.Update Even though they retracted the cease and desist the fact remains is that they did it in the first place. And the game is still being ruined on purpose.

Personally I'm enjoying much more than H1Z1.This game has a much larger selection of weapons and the attachments are a game changer. Rather than shuffle back and forth while tagging each other you can engage in more fulfilling firefights. Combat happens at much further distances thanks to scopes. Tactics are more important than ever none of this hop out of a car and mow people down crap.The game needs some optimization yes but it's already leaps and bounds ahead of H1Z1.

Game still crash sometimes but most of the time i can reconnect and continue playing.Yay Best fps game i ever played (my opinion) not talking about story line games tho. BR gamemode is entertaining this is next step gaming it's not just a trend. They keep adding content even if they should work on fixing issues first this will keep the game from dying and i doubt it will stop so no you are not wasting your money. Zone is well balanced keep pushing you but not too much. Different situations all the time.Conclusion this is my favourite game but they really need to work on servers and they surely will they showed us that they listen to us it take some time but it should happen give them a chance ) . (1000 euro compo and it runs really fine (without the lags) i play on lowest graphics tho but by choice not for perfomences).

I simply told them that I wished to have my money and rank put back to where it was.They told me that the hack was coming from my computer and was not given to me by someone else. I am given a supsension and my progress will be reset. I wouldn't have been too mad except I had spent money on the criminal enterprise starter pack and was told it would not be refunded or given to me again.Basically Rockstar support sucks. This game is good if you can manage to not get banned for something you didn't do.2/10 DO NOT buy this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

You know those games that each kill means something? It makes you feel great. Not the call of duty kill 30 people and not feeling any satisfaction from those kills. With each kill I get I feel like that kill could be a youtube video by itself! The only problem I have been having is FPS issues. My rig is definitely on the high end scale and yet I only get around 30fps on low settings and even lower when recording or streaming. This is due to poor optimization. The Dev Team has put out that this is the first thing that they will be working on so hopefully we won't have to wait long.

Yes it's an open world game with high render range but even then you have games like The Witcher 3 which not only look better but have a lot more going on at the same time while running much much better.Next the gameplay. This is subjective because I just can't seem to find the 'hook' that catches my interest and to keep me wanting to play the game. I don't like having to run around a huge map looking for loot just to get gunned down by some random player whom you never saw. Just not my cuppa tea.And the bugs.

347,2017-07-02,0,0,31,True,Recommended,I like this game It's got a great concept. It runs superb on my rig with everything turned on max settings. I am happy to see it's getting a lot more content Especially the zombie mode coming up (Which looks fun but I hope there is more to it than just running in open fields and shooting at zombies).Only gripes I have (More of a idea I hope they add but probably will not)When you die it would be nice to see who killed you? Like in CoD or BF. I think this is just a cool idea as well as possibly help with seeing if the person who killed you may have been cheating or something to that degree. Sometimes when I see people die that I'm watching or if I die it's a little questionable considering where I was standing.Boats I've had this happen and seen this happen to a few of my friends. When they are so close to the shore that they get stuck It would be cool to see some sort of action (or even an animation) to be able to put the boat back in the water even if it takes a little bit of time.Vehicles I haven't seen a vehicle NOT have any gas in it as soon as I get in it (That's just me personally) but I hope to see cars that don't have any just already in it Making it harder for people to move so far in such a short amount of time.That's just my 2 cents.

There's no help. There's no way to get a decent fps no way to deal with the breaking lag. I will say this in it's defense What it does do it does well. The game plays on very low settings. The matches are fun when you can play a good one with little lag. The shooting is clean and clear. Weapons work. However one of the downsides once you pick up a weapon melee is no longer an option.

373,2018-11-28,0,0,137,False,Recommended,Overall game is very good.Pros A lot of people are complaining about cheaters in any PC game which is competitive the game has cheaters ( didn't encountered not a single one in 130+hours of play ) but the company really cares about the game and banning actively them. They ban them in such a way that to return to the game is very difficult or costly meaning 1 banned cheater is gone he will not return for a while. Game very competitive and addictive has a lot of content had so much fun playing and very interested in streamers who stream the game. Developers are updating the game constantly every month they are presenting new features its like monthly Christmas you know that some big update will arrive and it actually changes the game and makes it better. The game has modded servers it means that if you want some different things you can easily join modded servers. ( For example if you want only to build you can join building servers same goes with PVP or anything you can think of ) Best survival game that exists to this day. Don't trust anyone who has 2 legs Involves skill you can't buy anything for money which will make you better it's not pay to win game it requires time ( much more time than i have 130+ hours ) and patience. Overall more you play you get better not your weapons or character.Cons The game badly needs optimization I have very high end PC and the game has FPS drops watched a lot of videos played with settings but didn't fixed the problem. This game badly needs optimization. Some bugs are there for months for example the bug where you can't pick up item because body is on top of the item and you need to remove body in order to pick up gun this is very annoying because sometimes you don't have even 1 second to waste. And other bugs which I checked are reported to facepunch studios. The game badly needs huge advertisement campaign to attract more people to the game I mean this game is the best survival game that exists and the same time sometimes servers are not full and lack people i understand that there are thousands of servers but the player base can be increased dramatically with the right advertisement. The game has so much content and for the beginner its pretty hard to understand everything how to do certain things i love that there was helping tips but its not enough.Overall If you like survival style games this is a MUST play game There is no better game than this in survival genre. BUY IT.,Rust

389,2019-02-11,0,0,38,False,Recommended,Pros Beautiful game great color and design.Interesting base building.Interesting research mechanics.Lots of room to explore.Lots of depths to uncover.Multiplayer!Cons There's no real threat at any point. The few environmental hazards are easily overcome.The exploration tends to be simply for the sake of exploration with a fairly uninteresting slog up the tech tree.Storage is a complete nightmare. You can't even build a storage container that holds more than your *backpack* until decently far into the game. Overall I find Astroneer to be a pleasant first experience. Great animations color palette and world generation makes one constantly pause in admiration. The base building system is well fleshed out and clever. The research system while a bit opaque with no tooltips is interesting and keeps you exploring.Where the game falls short for me personally is that with no real *threat* or hardship to overcome no real danger the game is really only interesting for a while. There's nothing to draw one back for another playthrough nothing to add that spike of excitement.I'd say the sale price is a good time to get what to me is a wonderful first experience with nearly zero replay value.,ASTRONEER

401,2016-01-01,0,0,1335,False,Recommended,"Im not the gamer GTA 5 was created for so keep this in mind when reading this review. I have no complaints about GTA 5 although I would prefer something with a lot less stealing and killing. I like the stock market feature and the cab runs gives me other options for making money with no violance and I wish I didnt have to wait for the Car Towing feature to unlock. Having the violance being part of the game is understandable for the games market. I will leave any debates about the violence to others. I could only suggest other features I would love to have in this game.Keep in mind I would pay for these features as program upgrades or add ons. 1.) Have a non story single player mode or free play I dont know enough about editor mode to know if this mode qualifies. I found it interesting but couldnt do much with it except being a super villian/Hero and battle an army single handedly for hours on end. Onlone mode is too intense for me. 2.) More side missions ( more on the side of short side missions ) For example More racing missions Bus driving missions Various Trucking missions and just more ways to make money while involved with the world population in some way similar to cab fairs or car racing ( Also similar to Triatholons Tennis and Golf ) For violence enthusiasts When in certain neighborhoods a prompt trigger gets activated when a person or gang member challenges you giving you the option to choose same as when driving by the car racing trigger. 3.) An easier playing level ( handicap ) for those of us who can't pass the missions by making the player harder to kill as a way to making the non story single player mode unneccerary or have the handicap feature available before all missions. 4.) This one is my favorite An upgrade or add on for an improved world A.I. (Maybe Artificial Intelligence Theme add ons for example). The focus on graphics are great. Wish my computer had the technology to run it at one of the higher graphics levels but I would prefer a higher level of A.I. in the game. For example the emergency vehicles still sometimes get stuck in the same spot doing circles and other hilarios antics have the population react in more than just two ways run off in fear or try to kill you. What about some one trying to stop me just to get a few angry words about almost running them over or bumping into them. Or instead of saying ""Cool car can I get a ride?"" but actually give one of them a ride for real basically more random characters with deeper personalities. Examples are endless.5.) Cash Cards for single player mode.6.) Be able to transfer money between characters.The multi character feature is innovative and fun unfortunately I won't live that long and have to start over making money for each character. I played for more than two hundred hours less than 20% story missions completed and made about $250 000 by mostly cab fairs and the stock market. Micheal was only recently available and have not played his character yet so you can only imagine how many cab fairs I must have done. Easily over 800 fairs. Its going to take me for ever to get far enough in the story missions to unlock the bussiness and property buying and vehicle collecting etc. Unless I find some kid to do the missions for me. At least I was able to purchase a garage for $30 000 to store my race cars and taxi cab. Still waiting to be able to buy the towing company so I can make money doing that for a change. The cab fairs are becoming repetative since I have taken it to the extreme.I could go on but time is limitted.From a leasure game player thank you Rockstar North for being part of the Open World concept.After thought Now that I have played over a thousand hours in the single player mode and some online my only hope is that GTA 6 doesn't take forever and has the option to run on lower range gaming systems like mine. Difficulty level in the missions was great once I found out I can pass a mission after my third try and still be able to progress in the game genius!",Grand Theft Auto V

413,2017-06-14,0,0,20,False,Recommended,As I promised I am changing my review from a negative one to a positive one following the reversal of the decision to order a cease &amp desist to OpenIV's modding team. I'm glad they have rethought this decision and made the right call. I do enjoy this game but I did get a little bored with it after a while. I really do need the mods to stay interested and even then it gets a bit stale. The online portion is a hellhole filled with microtransactions and people doing annoying stupid things so I say stay away from there unless you're into that. But I would recommend the single player game for sure.Below is my previous review I referenced above.Take Two has made a very consumer hostile decision in deciding to issue a cease &amp desist to the OpenIV team who make (or I guess made) a platform for modding GTA for the past ten years. The only reasoning that can be pointed to is that Take Two has decided that they have not been getting the in game micro transaction revenue they want from the multiplayer portion and so are actively trying to cripple the singleplayer portion to drive people over. This move essentially disables the majority of mods made for the game and their future development. I know I am not alone in buying GTA V on PC in part for the ability to mod the game. Modding is part of what makes gaming on PC intriguing and is something that should never be made illegal which is what Take Two has done in their attack on OpenIV and their own player base. Shame on Take Two. I love the game but it's better with mods. I am leaving a bad review of this game in protest of their actions and will gladly change it back to a positive review if Take Two reverses their decision.,Grand Theft Auto V

429,2014-01-26,0,0,65,True,Recommended,"What can I say about this game that people already haven't?I suppose I should start by saying that this game is hard. Really hard at least for newcomers looking for a new survival game to play. This is by no means a ""realistic Minecraft"" in any way. Don't expect to be able to get far in this game fast by going solo or even with just 1 other friend to help you. As much potential as this game has I find it hard to play it without getting extremely frustrated by the fact no matter what you try to obtain to build a life for yourself in this game it can all be taken away with one well placed shot from a player more equipped than you (This is all based of PVP servers).I understand that that's the point of this game that it gives you the option to choose whatever path you take in this game whether that be good or bad but that's also the one of the game's flaws that can't really be changed since you run the risk of restricting the player to begin with. Unless you're just starting out 9 times out of 10 you'll just be gunning down every person that you stumble across. You kill them so that already sets them back in terms of items that they had on them and unless they had a spawn point and a decent base with extra supplies built up that means they start back from square one all over again. And even if they had a base built up I'm sure it would've taken some. if not a lot of those supplies to make whatever they had in the first place anyway. Killing other players off when you get the chance only gets you benefits in the long run.This is an Alpha though so I guess I really shouldn't be saying too much in terms of flaws this game might have since there is already bound to be SOME. I guess my only other question is ""How can they fix a part of the game that should give you free will to decide without restricting the player?"" I'm eager to see if they can come up with one.As for actually recommending this I would definitely do so but just remember one thing. This game IS NOT for the casual player. If you really want to play this game and get things fast play it with about 3 5 other friends if you can.Strength in numbers.",Rust

479,2015-07-16,0,0,438,False,Recommended,"Psyonix's 'Rocket League' created in the unreal engine has offered an experience unlike any other. The gameplay is simplistic yet can be utilized with a wide variety of skill and technique. A player can have fun and be good at the game within 20 minutes of picking the game up but cannot truly master some of the techniques until he has clocked hundreds of hours into the game. Because of the gameplay of Rocket League it is unusual that a game will end in a severe blowout or that one team will seriously outperform the other as it is difficult to be very good or very bad at the game. The AI while generally not as tactic wise as a player tends to perform at a level similar to most players and therefore being with an AI in no terms means a certain defeat. The games are short just 5 minutes long which is plenty of time for about 3 4 goals to be scored in total so both teams are always still in the competition a game is rarely over until the last 10 seconds or so. The games are short enough so that if the teams DO end up somewhat stacked the less skilled team will not have to endure a slaughter for an extended time which we often find in many FPS games in which a winner can clearly be determined after about half of a match. Also it is unnecessary for a player to have a great deal of soccer knowledge or experience as the gameplay is while similar in some regards quite different in most. The game features 3 play modes ""Online"" ""Exhibition"" and ""Season"". All play modes offer the options of playing 1v1 referred to as ""Duel"" 2v2 or ""Doubles"" 3v3 which is ""Standard"" and 4v4 called ""Chaos"". Exhibitions are exactly what you would expect them to be you can quickly set up and play a game strictly with AIs. A ""Season"" allows you to set up and play other AI teams in an attempt to make the playoffs and continue on to win the tournament. Unfortunately the only number of other teams that can participate is 9 for a total of 10 teams competiting. You can play either a 9 18 27 or 36 week season so each team plays every other team an even number of times. From there either 4 or 6 teams make the playoffs which are single elimination. ""Online"" allows you to play with other players from around the globe which you may do with a party of your friends or solo. You may also play private games with strictly your friends and AIs. Matchmaking is quick and easy it allows you to select what servers you wish to use hit go and you get into a match generally within 30 seconds. The only downsides I see to this game as of now is the lack of play modes. The season idea is excellent but it would be nice if it was expandable to allow more teams and more customizability. Another idea would be multiplayer tournaments in which 8 teams maybe more could play a single elimination tournament online. If a player were to quit out of his team he could recieve a temporary tournament play suspension. I feel that this would be an excellent addition that would allow especially for party play more competition into the game.Overall I give Rocket League a 9.5/10.",Rocket League®

505,2017-08-21,0,0,23,True,Recommended,I have heard both good and bad reviews for this game but I cannot deny that above all this game is FUN! it's a weird brand of fun though and I know it's not for everyone ( different strokes for different folks and all that ) sure it has it's problems but it's still in it's infancy and it's already massively popular for good reason. Don't be mislead by those that condemn this game for it's micro transactions ( for the love of pete it's only for cosmetic items like t shirts and ball caps ) and besides the developers are only following the business patterns of the industry and you can't fault them for wanting to get paid for a product they are selling. If you don't want to spend your parents hard earned money on crates you dont have to. The idea of the game is solid fresh and above all FUN! ( there's that word again you spoiled mouth breathing trolls remember fun yeah? ) it's a no hold barred shootfest across a massive island that has more character and soul than anything triple A developers in the industry are pumping out every six months and it doesnt even have a single player campaign you loot scoot and shoot your way to an ever decreasing playing field all the while looking over your shoulder for the guy or gal that's going to fill you full of lead or run you over with a jeep or pummel you with a frying pan Samwise Gamgee style or blow you up with a frag grenade heck you could even have the misfortune of being hit by one of the many random artillery strikes that occur all across the map to discourage camping sure sometimes i last as long as a 16 year old boy losing his virginity on prom night but you can just back out once you're dead and go at it again (like a 16 year old boy on prom night) rinse and repeat over and over again until you've had enough punishment and call it quits (or rage quit if your mum doesn't or didnt hold you enough).the one issue I personally have the biggest problem with is no mic mute. So for the first minute or so while you wait to deploy your auditory senses are treated to the chorus of spastics who will wail curse rock out attempt to rap use every curse word in the english (and other) language eat thier mics call eachother homosexuals proclaim that *insert name of country here* is number one tell eachother to shut up and generally be belligerent and abusive (so par for the course for online gaming). There are other minor issues but my current PC is only able to run the game smoothly on low graphics settings and it still looks and plays very well never has a surefire kill been stolen from me due to lag or glitches of any kind. I was skeptical of this game for a while which is why it took me so long to purchase and play but i have no regrets about my purchase and i only have high hopes for the future of this fine peice of electronic entertainment. 9/10 I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a good contemporary shoot em up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are a few bugs here and there but this game is fresh off the boat and I have no doubt that every legitimate problem will be addressed. I hope that the devs don't cave to the rage quitters. I've played mostly survivor since launch (as most people are queueing up to be killers creating a small wait time to be one) and I've found that there's a fair and balanced strategy to counter every killer. Sometimes there's no getting away and that's just the ""luck"" aspect of the game. Playing as a killer can be just as challenging and each has its own separate avenues for advantages.

520,2017-09-20,0,0,845,False,Not Recommended,The game started out with several issues but remained fun to play. Over time the developers have become incredibly greedy. They push more and more locked crates so you need to buy keys to get anything decent in the game. Then they made it so that you can get locked crates using your coins at random so you're not even guaranteed free items after spending dozens of hours playing the game. They fix minor issues and leave the glaring major ones in the game. They have yet to implement any decent anti cheat measures so you will watch replays of getting killed by someone on the other end of the map aiming nearly straight up to compensate for bullet drop and then watching the bullet travel across the entire map to headshot you through bars. I had fun with it every so often but it's become so much of a headache and crashes a lot despite having a really good gaming rig. The servers have hours long maintenance every so often that ends up taking several hours more than estimated because the patches always break something else. There's a reason the playerbase has dropped so sharply so they're selling the game at a discount for the summer sale in the hopes of getting more people to drain money from while pumping out even more locked content and releasing a new map to pretend it isn't all just to get more money. Honestly unless you're absolutely DYING to play a battle royale game I'd avoid this piece of trash that just keeps getting worse over time instead of better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Long range is another story as it starts to feel like throwing darts at ants due to the bullet drop and the good chance you won't find a decent scope for that rifle you're holding RNG is a huge factor in this game. Armor is also hilariously overpowered in this game. A level 3 vest and helm turns you into a proper bullet sponge. As a $30 title this is still a decent game to pick up.

548,2018-02-18,0,0,61,False,Not Recommended,First off let me say that I used to love playing this game. It was an interesting concept and showed potential. Now what started as a fun game to play has turned into a piece of garbage. Every match is riddled with aimbots and cheating software and it's getting worse over time. The developers aren't doing enough to stop the cheating and it's ruining the game for all of the honest players. What's fun about waiting in a lobby full of obnoxious people for 1 minute for a match to start investing 30 minutes into surviving only to get shot once by an aimbot and die? Not to mention there's only two maps to play on with no way of voting on the map post match. This game needed some more work and polishing before it was released. The developers only care about the money they made from the 30 million sales though. I don't expect the community for this game to stick around much longer if they continue to show a lack of support. It's pretty much turning into another one of those early access games that makes a lot of money then dumped. I don't recommend this product I can't anymore.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The second downside apllies mostly to casual games where you find all those salty players who leave at the very instant when the other team scores a 1 2 or a 0 1.Overall it is a brilliant game with great gameplay mechanics and a mostly very nice community.",Rocket League®

634,2018-01-01,0,0,444,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V review for online and story mode!First off Story Mode is personally my most favorite part about this game. (even though they canceled the DLC for story mode for some GTA Online t.) The reason I love story mode the most because of how they re introduced you to the fantasized version of california San Andreas. Also with the characters. Micheal De Santa is an ex crook who ""retired"" and moved to the richer part of Los Santos from North Yankton to get away from his problems. But then he got even more problems when he moved away. Then comes Franklin Clinton who is hands down my favorite character just because of how much he develops through the game. He lives in the southern part of San Andreas around where Grove Street was in GTA SA. He went from doing grunt work by repoing cars to living in Vinewood hills in an awesome house givein to him by one of his friends. Then there is Trevor Phillips. He is a VERY interesting man. Trevor worked with Micheal back before he retired. When he thought Micheal was a dead man after he escaped the cops in the first scene in the game he moved to the hillbilly/redneck part of San Andreas. When he got settled in he still persued criminal actions and cooked meth. So I reccommend this game for Story Mode. I played it about 1 3 times because it never gets boring.Now for Online. I loved online when I had this game on the xbox. It was just so straight forward and not a grind fest. Do missions get money buy cars and around and have fun with friends. then the game got really cool with the vehicle updates and heists. Thats when the game was still really fun and not a grind fest. But then these new updates came around where vehicles bunkers hangars and etc. would cost over 1 mil. And by the time you got that and got the money u needed the new update would come out with cooler items and it was repetitive grindy and became p2w. Now for my final answer I like GTA online because of what you can do on it. But it sometimes get really annoying when you have to buy a sharkcard for something to be used or for something to be done.But overall I love this game and I reccommend it to alot of people. But dont let CEO/Bunker/MC/Air Freight work get to you cuz then thats when you get annoyed and would want to stop playing it.",Grand Theft Auto V
635,2018-01-14,0,0,86,False,Recommended,PUBG Review With the full game being released for around a month now I wanted to give a detailed review of the game and what still needs to change.Gameplay 6/10 Although a significantly polished version to the early access the gameplay still suffers from lag and stuttering issues. The main stutter the bad stutter making the game unplayable has been cleared however when on the starting area and when on the plane it suffers serverly from frame drops to around half what you would normally get. It also seems to have a problem staying at a constant fps from a long period of time I was stood still in a game to test this and still had frame drops of about 4 15 fps although some may not see this difference when you play 60fps it becomes frustrating. Despite this playing is still fun and very competitive whether playing solo or with friends. The progression of the circle isn't too random or unfair to players and the weapons are balanced in both drop rates based on it's effect on a game and against other weapons(eg. a pistol doesn't destroy someone with a scar). One thing that was rather odd was the random ammo in houses I understand why this drop exists but when you find a house non looted full of ammo only it can become rather annoying. Overall good but still needs some improvement.Graphics 9/10 This games graphics can only be described through 1 word Beautiful. It's graphics are a perfect balance of performance and asthetics although the aforementioned frame drops have meant some settings have been lowered. As I find with most games the shadows effect fps quite heavly although as I don't see a huge advantage of them in this game this can be lowered with no severe issues being had in the ways of gameplay. Weirdly the effects made a big difference for me in the case of fps but when changing it no difference could be seen. The textures again weirdly didn't seem to have an effect on my fps like alot of other games do with them on very low and every thing else bar effects and shadows being on ultra I got 80 and with textures on ultra 60 70 was what I layed at. Weird but very nice to people with lower end cards. Great work on the graphics.Mechanics 10/10 This is the main part of the game which I truly felt was polished fully bar graphics and had the most work on. Now don't get me wrong driving is broken in certain vehicles and terrain but I felt as if this made the game more enjoyable and actually made me play more messing around with the vehicles trying some stunts or running people over while trying not to flip the car on a pebble the game became more entertaining with this. The drops are balanced and not overly populated in random areas they also drop better weapons less frequently a huge plus in the way of a competitive game. The circles progression is not aggressive to a point where it becomes impossible to actually stop for a moment to clear out an area while running from the oncoming circle a very well desgined feature. The parachuting is as expected working enough(the only problem I had was a visual glitch or 2) and amazingly the opening of doors is ordinary(a little anticlimatic I know). Add ons 7/10 Now this one will be brief. The cases are not bad but at the same time not great. Any microtransactions no matter what they do are good. You shouldn't have to pay to do anything in a game it should be able to earned however in PUBG's defence you can earn the crates and open them or sell them for an item you want howevr the gamescons when they were avaliable for purchase or the Desparado crate need keys which can not be earned which is a slap in the face if you earn them. However with the price of items being rather high on any item or than the basic tops or pants profit is significantly easier than CSGO although I still advise NO money is spent on crates or keys(I sound like a hypocrite if you look in my inventory so to clear that up all items I have were given to me uncased or bought using money from sold goods in PUBG).Overall 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It brings us back to our most primal instincts and without reason we continue to exist in the wild world. I definitely prefer the Legacy version over the experimental version having put many hours into each one. The experimental version is more of a building game. It's slower you don't see people as much but the building and crafting is a bit better in some ways. The Legacy version feels more like a game. It's more fun.

666,2014-03-05,0,0,3,True,Recommended,This game is fun and has great potential but there are some problems with it. PvP gets dull as new players get killed very easily and players with guns tend not to attack others with guns Building weapons takes less time and effort than it should and takes a lot of threat away from enemies and people alike Late gameplay boils down to finding food building an absurdly big house and making more weaponsI'm sure this game will be better later into development but for now it's merely acceptable.6/10,Rust

I bought this game with such a hope and excitment. Today I had the worst day firstly I have problem installing the game. It crapped out my hard drive had to increase the partition space so that the game could be installed. What is this ? It needs 150 GB to install 50 gb game. What compression or decryption are you guys running. Now that the game is installed it wont start. It just keeps crashing. Now I read these articles about User account names WTF is that. Why cant my game start in my windows account. So still I create a new user name then again try to start the game. Still crashes. I reboot my system around 5 times. I updated my graphic card gave all the exes Admin right. But nothing works. The launcher keeps crashing. I am bloody well not a developer but is this is what you call a product. Creating a ton of hype for the game and then you finally deliver it this poor execution and sell us this What is wrong with you guys cant you guys test it better. I am really dissappointed.

732,2017-07-20,0,0,503,False,Not Recommended,"**UPDATE AFTER 7 MONTHS**As good as this game is I cannot play it any longer nor would I recommend it to anyone else soley because of the insane amount of cheating going on. The last couple of weeks I played it ( early mid Jan) it seems every other match had people cheating. The worst part is becasue it happens so often it makes me question every death. Did they have ESP or Wallhacks? They seemed to know exactly where I was even though I hadn't moved or had a chance to be spotted by anyone. It has literally created such a bad taste in my mouth that it wasn't worth playing anymore. I moved to Fortnite where in a whole month of playing I haven't run into a single player that I suspected was cheating. Hopefully one day the cheating will be fixed I understand you can never stop it all but harsher punishments and ping lock seems to be the only answer at the moment. PUBG corp take what Fortnite has done with their anti cheat and apply it I know you both use Battleye but something you guys are doing isn't working. This is a review coming from a guy who hasnn't won a chicken dinner in over 30 hours of playtime. This game is great the circle that keeps closing in on you and forcing everyone to the ""middle"" makes this action packed at some point during the game and It supports all different styles of play.

759,2017-06-16,0,0,167,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a phenomenal game and it sucked having to rip into it but modding of PC games is a freedom owed to all and if a company attempts to destroy the vibrant community and enhancements that sprung from it we had to speak up. Thankfully our voices were heard (and hopefully some closed wallets contributed) and Take Two has since reneged since Rockstar hadn't authorized them acting on their interests and have since allowed OpenIV to continue development.Now I would highly recommend the game to anyone interested in a detailed open world with plenty of opportunity for mayhem a captivating story with great characters a bangin' soundtrack with original score and solid game mechanics to keep it all flowing.As for GTA Online it's good for what it is but only play if you have a few friends to play with over Discord or something as solo it's nothing but a chaotic grindy mess. And DO NOT BUY SHARK CARDS THEY ARE AN ENABLER OF SIN.If you're looking for more out of your game experience download OpenIV here http //openiv.com/and download mods here https //www.gta5 mods.com/ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWING TAKE TWO'S MOD BAN BELOWIf this was a month ago I would have given this game a favorable review plenty of new content being released through the years new vehicles weapons mission types game modes clothing it's simply marvelous.I could have proselytize the merits of PC originated features like the first person view mode Rockstar Editor and highest quality settings possible.I could have mentioned the vast community of creative types making machinima.I could have mentioned the enormous array of fantastic mods.But I won't now because according to Take Two and Rockstar modding is illegal.For those not in the know Take Two filed a cease and desist against OpenIV a file navigation and editing tool for various Rockstar games including GTA V that allow mod creators to do truly amazing things to expand the possibilities of their games. Also know that both Take Two and Rockstar are complicit Take Two claiming violation of intellectual property and Rockstar claiming it to be the cause of GTA Online's notorious hacking problem even though OpenIV was only intended for single player use and will actually crash your game if you attempt to go online with mods enabled through it.OpenIV and its creators have been operating as clean as a modding tool can be expected to and have no reason to be halted by greedy bastards who are mad more people aren't buying Shark Cards. (in game currency)If you own GTA V I urge you to sign this petition https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openivI urge you to email Take Two and Rockstar Games directly on their official websites.And most important I urge you to refrain from purchasing any games under Take Two's umbrella that means no buying Rockstar or 2K's games. DON'T BUY THEM NOT EVEN ON SALE NO SHARK CARDS EITHER YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.In fact I'd advise against playing GTA Online period simply enjoy the singleplayer with mods cuz it's your GODDAMN RIGHT. Download an offline installer of OpenIV 2.9 (the latest version) and wait for ScriptHookV and RAGE Plugin to receive compatibility updates then start modding like crazy.Then share your modded gameplay.Rub it in their faces.Show them that it's OUR SOFTWARE WE CAN DO WHAT WE LIKE WITH IT AND THAT THEY CAN'T STOP MODDING!,Grand Theft Auto V

768,2018-08-18,0,0,40,False,Recommended,This game is by far and away the best entry in the Monster Hunter series. The only complaints below that I thought had any merit were mouse and keyboard controls (Which they said they're working on) that can be circumvented entirely with a gamepad (how monster hunter has been played since it's creation) and online connectivity issues. The monsters are amazing the environment is amazing the gameplay is amazing you feel more in control of your hunter than in any of the past games.If you're a fan of the series don't even hesitate. If you have ever wondered what the craze about monster hunter has been in the past this is the best entry to give it a try on.Cut scene fights to progress the story can't be STARTED with friends but they can come help with an SOS flare. I can see how people would think that is tedious. But if we take a step back and realize that in all past entries urgent quests to progress the story had to be done offline solo with no option to call in help I'd rather have a tedious work around than no option to have friends help at all.The ports great don't be dissuaded by the negativity.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Now you or the stuff you worked your but off to get is safe ever. I like this type of game but I can only start over so many time before it just gets stupid. Now coming back after 6+ months to see to new rust is broken beyond what legacy rust ever was.... I think the devs have taken 1 step forward and about 1000000 back. this is turning into nothing more then a permanent early access alpha than will run out of cash to back it before it is ever completed in any playable state never mind that most of the community has vanished. This is a joke of a game shame I can't get my cash back. Updated Ok so decided to give this another shot. Came back to see a rather long list of updates and pretty often too to my surprise knowing Gary's track record with broken half arsed games. Rust is shaping up to be a pretty good game.

The changes that I've seen being made over the time I've played have been very good. The reponse from the devs and their streams every week show that they really care about the players. The player base however is full of salt. Both on Killer and Survival side. Only con I have is the DLC for the Clown is kinda meh I think they could have gone with better dynamics. The killer model is great looking though.,Dead by Daylight

When I started it was fun but the more I've gotten into it the more monotonous it is and the community is purely toxic. You have a bunch a people who only want to play survivor and a bunch of people playing killer and both sides are screaming at each other about how unfair the other side has it in terms of tweaks to the game. The biggest flaw I'm finding right now is that you have killers camping survivors that they hooked moreso since they implemented the emblem system. It makes the game excrutiatingly boring. Assuming you don't want to screw over your team if you're hooked you're just sitting there staring at the killer. If someone else is hooked and camped you're just performing endless skill checks on gens with no one chasing you. If I could get my money back I would.,Dead by Daylight

887,2018-08-13,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World has been the most fun game I have played in a long time. I have only played 2 games before this and I would say it's a great improvement and change to the other series. The attacks and dodges are more responsive. No need to hassel and paintball monsters every couple minutes. Extra inventory by not needing to prepare paintballs nets and pickaxes. Ability to play bowguns similar to a third person shooter (playing range on the DS was a nightmare). Maps are huge with secret camps NPCS and cats scattered around. Monster on monster action!!! The weapon upgrade tree is amazing. The environment has so many cool interactions with basic attacking or even using the slinger shot on flash bugs healing wasps sleeping/ paralysis toads etc. I could continue talking to someone for hours about this game.As for the cons I would say like many other people the disconnecting part sucks. Sometimes I cannot join a matchmaking lobby or my friend's game. The way I have found that seems to work is to start offline then join an online lobby. Also the connection seems to work better if you join one with more people in it instead of a private lobby. Another con is that there's people but it's rare to actually hunt with a random person. People seem to stick to themselves or their groups. Also since the maps are so large without the scoutflies guiding you up and down the levels it can be very confusing when on an expedition. Plus those egg quests are always awful.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

918,2017-08-26,0,0,1367,False,Not Recommended,Don't Buy It!After a month of grinding to get money for the upcoming DLC Rockstar too $9123 890 from me. All legitimate money!!I had an open support ticket prior to the money confiscation about multiple transaction errors. It is a Rockstar anti cheat code that prevents legitimate players from actually earning money. I don't know if it is retaliation for my open support ticket or what.WHAT I DO KNOW IS Rockstar does little to nothing about hackers/modders.Lobbies are full of modders/hackers/people that have modded money and those people make it intollerable to play legitimately because these people have NO REASON to play legit and they do not share the common desire/goal to do the activities to get the money. The people constantly attack you some of which have God mode and you can't even kill them or mod items in that make it impossible for you to complete your desired tasks/work.When there is a level 10 with a bunker and an Oppressor motorcycle you know you are going to be ****** by him/her. He is obviosly a cheater.I was willing to do the grinding gunrunning car import/export vip work and helping others with similar work but to constantly have transaction errors and a complete lack of support from Rockstar in addition to them taking $9million from me I can say that I AM DONE with Rockstar and GTA.,Grand Theft Auto V

921,2015-05-31,0,0,81,False,Recommended,"It's a great well made game that's clearly had a lot of time put into by people who know what they are doing. The campaign is a good mixture of funny and enticing and I'm looking forward to putting more time into the single player. Despite this it's not the best GTA ever made. I personally prefer the style of the other GTA's (San Andreas comes to mind) where you only play as one character as I believe you feel more connected to that character as they go through a story line. It wouldn't have been the same if you could actually play as Ryder or Wu Zi back in the day.The online is great fun the first few days of playing it with my friends was nothing but hilarious however once the excitement passes and you need something ""more"" to keep you playing I feel GTA V falls behind other somewhat similar games such as Altis Life on Arma 3. First of all as someone who preordered I received enough money as a gift to buy the best appartment and one of the best cars. After doing a few heists I could then afford the best car. Umm now what? Mindless races and missions are fun for a while but it could be so much better if there was more to spend your money on.

PUBG have over 30 guns with diffrent statistics ( diffrent recoil diffrent damage diffrent range etc ) which are so realistic you will feel like firing a real gun!!! and by that really need to work on your shooting before playing this game because due to this realisticness in guns shooting system is pretty diffrent than other shooting games. the game core gameplay is really simple but there are tons of various strategy's to win the game maybe you are a cautious player want to avoid other players while moving toward the safe zone or the opposite you're a spary and pray kind of guy . either way you are free to play in the way you want.there are however some downsides to this game and one of them is the annoying bugs and glitches that WILL ruin your experience and the other thing is the game's poor optimization on weak computers... i mean if you want to have a 1080 p 60fps smooth gameplay you must at least have a GTX 1070 graphic card other wise you must tweak the graphic options alot to achieve that smooth gameplay.but the game IS a must play because it is really good (even with those problems that has).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

986,2017-10-29,0,0,1181,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun as hell to play with as a survivor or killer but here is why i wouldnt reccomend playing it even though i will still continue to play it myself 1. The survivors are very toxic they will take the game hostage and try to taunt the killer right at the exit gates so they can hurridly leave (even if you play as freddy which i do and blood warden really isnt useful in that sense actually)2. it takes an outrageous ammount of time (as a killer) to find a ing game to play (for me its about 30 minutes per match but ive seen others where its an hour wait) and then people will DC as soon as they realize its freddy fun right?3. As a survivor many killers just want to camp you if your on the hook because usually people will try to unhook you so actually trying to unhook people just goes away once you know the killer wants to camp everyone they catch. 4. Survivors will constantly go through windows or stay around pallets to intentionally waste your time and then laugh about it once the round is over 5. Almost evertyime i try to play as a killer my game freezes and i disconnect from the round even though ive never had that problem as a survivor.6. The devs dont seem to care about the game. at all. Many people have had their memory whiped from the game there are still many bugs that need to be fixed and yet they want to add more killers and survivors and maps to a game that already has a good ammount of bugs in it. To me it just seems like they want to gain some money with new killers as fast as they can rather than actually trying to balance the game to help survivors and killers and to fix constantly occuring bugs that basically force people to rage quit.This game is extremly fun to play if you just want to casually get spooked for a few hours but if your actually trying to rank up....the killers are toxic and the survivors are even more toxic to deal with. This game has a lot of potential but i just cant reccomend it as it is now until there are some major changes to it / and to be honest i dont even know why im writing this the devs wont even look at it anyways because their probably too busy making the next killer/survivor designs.,Dead by Daylight

I have never regreted this purchase. This game is great and will continue to be great. Now it may not have the greatest graphics or physics but thats not what most players are looking for. they are looking for a game with a good story a game that's fun to play for hours on end without getting bored!

I'll just say that the base game is great but gets boring very quickly. I bought this game on PC strictly for the single player mods and that kept me coming back significantly extending the replay value. Now that the mods I enjoyed are no longer supported I have absolutely no reason to even have this game installed on my computer. The online mode is full of hackers and just sucks in general so I cannot in good faith recommend purchasing this game new to anybody anymore.If you've never played this game before please purchase it second hand so that you are not feeding into the publisher's greed.
